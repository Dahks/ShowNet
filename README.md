# ShowNet
Trying to make plots of Igraph graphs prettier in Jupyter Notebooks.

# Tools
Using `cosmo.gl` because it's pretty, efficient, and easily configurable.

# Setup
Recommend using a venv:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, depending on IDE, you might need to configure the kernel used.
